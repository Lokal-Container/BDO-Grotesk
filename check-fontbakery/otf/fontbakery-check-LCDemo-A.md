>
>Other issues are outlines that end up reversed when only one dimension is flipped while the other isn't.
>
>As of July 2019, Marc Foley observed that ttfautohint assigns cvt values to transformed glyphs as if they are not transformed and the result is they render very badly, and that vttLib does not support flipped components.

>It will look fine but not be searchable. This can affect Latin text with high-end typography, and some complex script writing systems, especially with higher-quality fonts. Those circumstances generally involve creating a PDF by first printing a PostScript stream to disk, and then creating a PDF from that stream without reference to the original source document.
